Installation instructions for LiveFreeOrDICOM

#############
Mac OS Sierra
#############

---------------
Pre-requisites:
---------------
Chrome or Firefox:
The web views are not supported on Internet Explorer or Safari.

PostgreSQL:
If you are familiar with PostgreSQL, you simply need to fill in the login information in
dvh/preferences/SQL_Connection.cnf.

If you are unfamiliar with SQL, simply go here and download the PostgreSQL app: http://postgresapp.com/
Open the app, Click "Start", then double-click "postgres" with the cylindrical database icon
type the following in the SQL terminal:
create database dvh;
NOTE: You may replace dvh with any database name you wish, but you must update dbname in
dvh/preferences/SQL_Connection.cnf to reflect what database name you chose.
This app must be running when writing or accessing data.

Xcode Command Line Tools:
Make sure Xcode command line tools are installed
If the full Xcode package is installed (from the Mac App Store), entire the following into a terminal window:
xcode-select --install

pip (python package management):
If you do not already have pip, enter the following into a terminal window:
easy_install pip

---------------------------
Setting up your environment
---------------------------
Download the entire source code from Github either via git or manual download (unzip and move to desired location).

From a terminal window, change your directory to the LiveFreeOrDICOM folder (e.g., cd ~/LiveFreeOrDICOM)

execute the install_mac.sh script by typing:
./install_mac.sh

------------------------
Processing test files
------------------------
From the same directory as the previous step, type the following:
python dvh/DICOM_to_SQL.py

This will take several minutes. DICOM_to_SQL will process all dicom files located in the inbox as specified
in the file dvh/preferences/import_settings.txt and move them into the location specified by imported.

--------
Web view
--------
From the same directory as the previous step, type the following:
bokeh serve --show dvh/
If Chrome or Firefox is not your default browswer, you'll need to copy and paste the url into Chrome or Firefox.
NOTE: Safari sort of works, but intermittently cuts off the websocket... so it's not reliable.
